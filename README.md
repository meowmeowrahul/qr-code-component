Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component

This is my solution to the QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor. The challenge was a great way to practice basic layout skills using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

🛠️ Built With

    Semantic HTML5

    Tailwind CSS

    Mobile-first responsive layout

    Flexbox

💡 What I Learned

    How to vertically and horizontally center content using Tailwind’s flex, items-center, and justify-center.

    How to structure a simple component layout with spacing and typography using utility classes.

    Importance of checking image paths and folder structures carefully when working with local assets.

Example snippet I’m proud of:

<div class="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">
  <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg text-center">
    <img src="..." class="rounded-xl" alt="QR Code">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-xl mt-4 mb-2">Improve your front-end skills...</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm">Scan the QR code...</p>
  </div>
</div>

🚀 Continued Development

In future projects, I want to:

    Explore better image handling and optimization.

    Practice more responsive and adaptive layouts.

    Dive deeper into accessibility best practices.
